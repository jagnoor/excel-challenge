Excel Homework: Kickstart My Chart

Background - Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,114 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
a.	Music category has most successful project percentage. 77% of project in this category were successful. Journalism (0%) and food (17%) are least successful projects. 
b.	Theater‚Äù category secured highest number of projects (33.86%) in the dataset and contributed maximum number (33.86% of dataset) of successful projects.
c.	Under Category theater, plays subcategory is most successful (65%). Music category has 5 subcategories with 100% success percentage. 
 


2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
a.	The raw data set provided includes data related to only 4115 projects out of 300000 projects that were launched. So, our conclusions are based only on a minimal set of data (1.37%) of the entire campaigns. 
b.	As we are working with just 1.37% of the possible raw data, 33.86% of the data is related to just one category, Theatre and the rest is unevenly spread among other categories. 
c.	This dataset only contains campaign launch data from Kickstarters and does not include additional data from other crowdfunded campaign platforms such as Indigogo, Angel investors, GoFundMe, etc. 

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a.	Year wise Trend 
b.	Country wise breakup of kickstarter projects.
